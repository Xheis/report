  title       = {Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms},
  year        = {2012},
  abstract    = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract    = {We present a tutorial on Bayesian optimization, a method of finding the maximum of expensive cost functions. Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

  abstract     = {There is a common observation that audio event classification is easier to deal with than detection. So far, this observation has been accepted as a fact and we lack of a careful analysis. In this paper, we reason the rationale behind this fact and, more importantly, leverage them to benefit the audio event detection task. We present an improved detection pipeline in which a verification step is appended to augment a detection system. This step employs a high-quality event classifier to postprocess the benign event hypotheses outputted by the detection system and reject false alarms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, we implement and pair up different event detectors based on the most common detection schemes and various event classifiers, ranging from the standard bag-of-words model to the state-of-the-art bank-of-regressors one. Experimental results on the ITC-Irst dataset show significant improvements to detection performance. More importantly, these improvements are consistent for all detector-classifier combinations.},

  abstract    = {State-of-the-art audio event detection (AED) systems rely on supervised learning using strongly labeled data. However, this dependence severely limits scalability to large-scale datasets where fine resolution annotations are too expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose a small-footprint multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for multi-class AED using weakly annotated labels. The proposed MIL framework uses audio embeddings extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network as input features. We show that by using audio embeddings the MIL framework can be implemented using a simple DNN with performance comparable to recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our approach by training an audio tagging system using a subset of AudioSet, which is a large collection of weakly labeled YouTube video excerpts. Combined with a late-fusion approach, we improve the F1 score of a baseline audio tagging system by 17%. We show that audio embeddings extracted by the convolutional neural networks significantly boost the performance of all MIL models. This framework reduces the model complexity of the AED system and is suitable for applications where computational resources are limited.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces the acoustic scene classification task of DCASE 2018 Challenge and the TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset provided for the task, and evaluates the performance of a baseline system in the task. As in previous years of the challenge, the task is defined for classification of short audio samples into one of predefined acoustic scene classes, using a supervised, closed-set classification setup. The newly recorded TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset consists of ten different acoustic scenes and was recorded in six large European cities, therefore it has a higher acoustic variability than the previous datasets used for this task, and in addition to high-quality binaural recordings, it also includes data recorded with mobile devices. We also present the baseline system consisting of a convolutional neural network and its performance in the subtasks using the recommended cross-validation setup.},
